    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These peanut butter cookies are deliciously soft and chewy in the middle. They taste great and are easy to make!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>      
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; beat in eggs.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture until dough is just combined. <br>
             Chill cookie dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour to make it easier to work with.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.<br>
             Flatten each ball with a fork, making a crisscross pattern.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
