    <h2>Description</h2>

    <P>This savory sausage breakfast casserole with hash brown potatoes, green onions, and cheese is easy to put together and <br>
        perfect for a hearty breakfast or weekend brunch. You can cook the sausage and green onions in a cast-iron skillet, <br>
        and use that to bake the casserole instead of a baking dish.</P>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package bulk breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package hash brown potatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>6 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 (2.64 ounce) package country gravy mix</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8x11-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir breakfast sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Mix green onion into the sausage and spread into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spread hash brown potatoes in a layer over top; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, and gravy mix together in a bowl until smooth; pour over casserole. Season with paprika.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the casserole comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let stand 10 minutes to firm up before serving.</li>
    </ol>
